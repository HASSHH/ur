# The Royal Game of Ur

An online version of the game Ur.
Still in development. 

To do/add:
-- UI stuff (spec counter);
-- Implement a chat between the two players (maybe for spectators too but probably not)

-- A Windows desktop console app that will be able to connect to the game server and play by itself (like a sparring partner). Will be a different project written in C# (will add link when I'll start to work on it); 

Current version is deployed here (functional but not complete): [https://the-royal-game-of-ur.herokuapp.com/](https://the-royal-game-of-ur.herokuapp.com/)
